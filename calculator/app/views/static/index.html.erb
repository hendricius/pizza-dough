          1) Pick the amount of pizzas you want to bake and your desired
          final dough weight. The weight depends on the size of your oven.</p>
        <p>
          2) You can optionally select the hydration of your dough or use
          the default 60%. This value depends on your flour.

          3) Calculate your perfect pizza dough.

        Typically the pizza dough weighs between 200 and 280 grams. For a
        home oven 250 grams is a recommended size. Change this value
        depending on the size of your oven.
      </p>
      <p>
        A real Neapolitan pizza consists of only flour water and salt.
        Traditionally sourdough has been used. Sourdough requires more
        advanced dough handling. Thus for beginners the yeast based dough
        is recommended. When making a sourdough pizza a stiff sourdough
        starter is recommended as it will boost the yeast rather than
        the bacteria. This allows for a longer leavening time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key is to have all the ingredients in the exact quantity. To
        calculate how much of each ingredient is used "Baker's Math" is
        applied. This means the ingredients are calculated based on the
        amount of flour that you are using. So lets say the ingredient
        would say 60%, that would mean per every 100 grams of flour you
        need to add 60 grams of water. This way you can easily scale up
        the amount of pizzas that you want to bake.
